# Shamzam-Coursework

This is a repository for my course work for the Enterprise Computing module at the University of Exeter. 
The specification should show:
 - S1 As an administrator, I want to add a music track to the catalogue, so that a user can listen to it.
 - S2 As an administrator, I want to remove a music track from the catalogue, so that a user cannot listen to it.
 - S3 As an administrator, I want to list the names of the music tracks in the catalogue, so that I know what it contains.
 - S4 As a user, I want to convert a music fragment to a music track in the catalogue, so that I can listen to it.
